This project aims to develop remote controlled and stable Vertical TakeOff & Landing(VTOL) Drone which supports high speed fixed wings flight. Now a days the trend of Quadcopters have been increasing for performing various functionalities but the Quadcopter on the average fly for about 25 mins, weigh 1280 grams, uses LiPo 4S having a capacity of4480 mAh having a range of nearly a kilometer which is insufficient for carrying out certain operations. For that purpose, we are making a VTOL that has the ability to fly for an hour atleast with an average speed of 50mph which is twice as fast as a Quadcopter. This increase in range and speed will be achieved but incorporating a fixed winged flight mode which requires less power and naturally produced higher ground speeds.
